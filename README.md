![Spectra Logo](./Spectrall.PNG)

**Spectra** is an offensive security framework developed in **Java**, combining modules for **fuzzing**, **lightweight reverse engineering**, and **exploit management**. Inspired by tools like **Ghidra** and **Metasploit**, Spectra offers a modern **JavaFX** GUI and a robust **MySQL** backend to centralize and automate your attacks.
